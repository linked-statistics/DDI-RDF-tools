      <abstract><![CDATA[IPUMS-International is an effort to inventory, preserve, harmonize, and disseminate census microdata from around the world. The project has collected the world's largest archive of publicly available census samples. The data are coded and documented consistently across countries and over time to facillitate comparative research. IPUMS-International makes these data available to qualified researchers free of charge through a web dissemination system.

The IPUMS project is a collaboration of the Minnesota Population Center, National Statistical Offices, and international data archives. Major funding is provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Demographic and Behavioral Sciences Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Additional support is provided by the University of Minnesota Office of the Vice President for Research, the Minnesota Population Center, and Sun Microsystems.]]></abstract>

SAMPLE DESIGN: In locations where the sample fraction is 10 percent, 100 percent of households are chosen. In locations where the sample fraction is 20 percent, every 2nd household is chosen with a random start. For the remaining locations were there is not a sample, every 10th household is chosen. In group quarters, the sample was not applied in the enumeration. They are chosen as a systematic sample of every 10th person with a random start. The sample was elaborated by INDEC.

SAMPLE UNIT: Household

SAMPLE FRACTION: 10%

SAMPLE UNIVERSE: 100% of the population and households enumerated. The 1980 census used a sample for the application of the long questionnaire form. The fraction of the sample varies according to the size of location.

Before data may be distributed to an individual researcher, an electronic license agreement must be signed and approved.

To gain access to the data, a researcher must agree to the following:

(1) Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access to census microdata. Under IPUMS-International agreements with collaborating agencies, redistribution of the data to third parties is prohibited.

(2) Use the microdata for the exclusive purposes of scholarly research and education. Researchers must explicitly agree to not use microdata acquired for any commercial or income-generating venture.

(3) Maintain the confidentiality of persons, households, and other entities. Any attempt to ascertain the identity of persons or households from the microdata is prohibited. Alleging that a person or household has been identified is also prohibited.

(4) Report all publications based on these data to IPUMS-International, which will in turn pass the information on to the relevant national statistical agencies.

Once a project is approved, a password is issued and data may be acquired through the Internet. Penalties for violating the license include: revocation of the license, recall of all microdata acquired, filing of a motion of censure to the appropriate professional organizations, and civil prosecution under the relevant national or international statutes.

These safeguards mirror the principles from the Joint ECE/Eurostat Work Session on Statistical Data Confidentiality. Employees of the Minnesota Population Center who work with the census microdata to produce the harmonized database also sign agreements to respect the confidentiality of the data.

IPUMS-International works with each country's statistical office to minimize the risk of disclosure of respondent information. The details of the confidentiality protections vary across countries, but in all cases, names and detailed geographic information are suppressed and top-codes are imposed on variables such as income that might identify specific persons. In addition, IPUMS-International uses a variety of technical procedures to enhance confidentiality protection. These include the following:

(1) Swapping an undisclosed fraction of records from one administrative district to another to make positive identification of individuals impossible.

(2) Randomizing the placement of households within districts to disguise the order in which individuals were enumerated or the data processed.

(3) Aggregating codes of sensitive characteristics (e.g., grouping together very small ethnic categories)

(4) Top- and bottom-coding continuous variables to prevent identification of extreme cases.

The safety record for public-use census microdata is apparently perfect. In almost four decades of use, there has not been a single verified breach of statistical confidentiality. The measures implemented by the IPUMS-International are designed to extend this record.]]></confDec>

      <txt><![CDATA[SERIAL is an identifying number unique to each household in a given sample. All person records are assigned the same serial number as the household record that they follow. (Person records also have their own unique identifiers -- see PERNUM.) The combination of SAMPLE and SERIAL provides a unique identifier for every household in the IPUMS-International database; SAMPLE, SERIAL and PERNUM uniquely identify every person in the database. 

SERIAL can be used to identify dwellings in some samples.  In these samples, the first 7 digits of SERIAL provide the dwelling number common to all households that were sampled from the same structure.  The last three digits give the sequence of the household within the dwelling.  The following is a list of samples in which dwellings can be inferred:

Chile 1970, 1992, 2002
Colombia 1993, 2005
Costa Rica 1984, 2000
Ecuador 1990, 2001
Hungary 1980, 1990, 2001
Malaysia 1970, 1991, 2000
Mexico 1995, 1990, 2000, 2005
Panama 2000
Portugal 1981, 1991, 2001
Spain 1991
Venezuela 1990, 2001
Vietnam 1989  


In all other samples, the last 3 digits are always zeroes.

SERIAL was constructed for IPUMS-International, and has no relation to the serial number in the original datasets.]]></txt>

Institutions typically retain persons under formal supervision or custody, such as correctional institutions, military barracks, asylums, or nursing homes.  

Some of the usual information for households is often not available for group quarters and vacant units.]]></txt>

A. Geographic location
In this section of the questionnaire you should get the location of the dwelling to enumerate in the national territory and in the census organization.

This information should appear in all the questionnaires that you use.

Observe that in a. Geographic location, there are columns of cells, from left to right that correspond to hundreds, tens and single units.

For example:

[The instructions refer to a graphic of the census form.]

You will always fill out a cell for each column. When you should mark a number of two digits in a column of three cells, you should put zero in front of it.

Before beginning your route, you should complete in all of the questionnaires that you have received, the following information corresponding to: Department -- Fraction -- Area -- Segment, that your area supervisor will provide you.

The number of the dwelling, which you will obtain in your visits, you will assign in a correlated form marking 01 in the questionnaire that you use for enumerating the first dwelling, 02 for enumerating the second, and so on until finishing with all the dwellings that you find in your segment.

If in a building there are two or more dwellings, you will decide the order for enumerating, using a form for each dwelling unit.

Location of the dwelling
In all the cases you will complete the required information, which allow you to later identify the location the dwelling.

If the dwelling is not on a street or road, or if a number does not exist, you should use a fixed point as a reference. The reference can be a business, a public building, a road or a route. Among many options you will select that which you consider the most permanent in time. In the case of a very difficult location, you will make more than one point of reference.

For someone with more than one job, the primary occupation is usually the one in which the person had spent the most time or earned the most money, although this may not have been explicit in the instructions for a specific census.

To ensure confidentiality, very small occupations are recoded to a residual category indicating the persons had an occupation, but the job title is not identified.  The number of cases recoded should be too small to affect analyses.]]></txt>

Some samples use fewer than 4 digits.  In those cases, the data are right-justified, and the extra leading digits are padded with zeroes.

1. What is the relationship or relation with the head of the home?
Each private dwelling should necessarily have a head, who is the person recognized as such by the rest of the members of the household.

In the case of a group of non related persons someone should be recognized as head by the rest of the group. In the case of absence, the head of the household will not be enumerated in this household, another member should occupy their place (spouse, oldest child, sibling, etc.). The relationship of the rest of the members will be established with respect to the substitute.

[The instructions refer to a graphic of the census form.]

The spouse of the head will be enumerated second whether they are legally married or not.

In "other family member" register siblings, aunt/uncles, niece/nephews, cousins, brother/sister-in-laws of the head of the household.

Persons employed in domestic service will be enumerated as members of the census home when they coexist and sleep in the dwelling.

In "other non family member," consider other persons who coexist in the home for example pensioners, guests, etc.

[p. 9]

In collective households this question should not be asked. The enumerator will determine the order for enumerating, beginning with the one at the top of the hierarchy, but will not fill out any cell for question No. 1.
