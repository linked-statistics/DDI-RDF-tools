This folder contains two simple scripts (one shell and one python) that I originally wrote to handle the PDF transformations in the DDI-FO part of DDI-XSLT, found at
http://code.google.com/p/ddixslt/

Olof (borna) thought that they might be adapted for use in this project as well. As of right now, they are simply copy-and-pasted into this forlder, and are yet to be modified.
